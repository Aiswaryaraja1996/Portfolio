            Hola! I am Aiswarya, a color fanatic, and an art lover. I enjoy
            doing paintings and crafts and being creative in everything I do.
            After completing electrical engineering, I stepped into the world of
            Information Technology. My passion for web development started with
            the thought of combining art and programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love visualizing and curating wonderful experiences with code,
            colors, and designs. Today I have completed a couple of projects and
            have got good hands-on with various front-end technologies. Besides,
            my professional experience helped me to become more adaptable and a
            good team player.
